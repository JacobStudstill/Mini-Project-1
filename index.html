        <p> Thank you for choosing Jacob's Orlando Yardcare for your yardcare needs. Our company was founded
            in the great city of Orlando. The company was founded in 1996. Our founder and CEO went to the University of
            Central Florida for horticulture. This means that the company didn't start for the money but rather the love
            of yarden and yard cultivation and management. Since then we have been hiring staff that shares
            that same passion. We pride ourselves on our ability to help yards and gardens to thrive in all seasons
            or to bring back a garden that has withered or that has dead spots. Take a look at our images of jobs that
            we have completed and check out our reviews as well. Our customers have also reported that since using our
            services, they have won multiple "Best Yards" for their neighborhood and a couple have won for the whole city
            of Orlando. If you are interested in our services, please click contact in our navigation bar at the top or
            scroll down to the bottom to fill out the contact form. We will reach out when we get the form so we can start 
            discussing how to make your yard goals a reality!
